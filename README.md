# The Benz Knober
This project is inspired by the Bastl Instruments '60 Knobs' controller and is my first experiment in hardware MIDI.

This project has a wide array of potentiometers attached to multiplexers, all of whom can have their channel and CC message number changed so that you have a truly customizable control board with an assignable envelope follower.

More updates, board diagrams, BOM, etc. upcoming.
